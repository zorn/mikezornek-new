## Shindig

Shindig was a startup I participated in as co-ownerÂ and CTO that provided a platform that would generate mobile apps (iOS, Android and Web) for attendees of conference-like events. The platform also included an Admin backend for managing all the data written in Rails. I did most of the Rails work and supervised the iOS and Android projects.

While we were about to run some events to satisfied customers, in time we shut down the company as we were not selling enough to match the money / effort we were making elsewhere doing things like freelance consulting. I did a longer retrospective of Shindig, which you can watch here:
