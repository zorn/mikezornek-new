This repo is a stage to get a modern version of Hugo with Tailwind working for MikeZornek.com. I'll work here and then eventually update the main repo.

## TODO

- [ ] Consider using asdf for Hugo version alignment.
- [ ] Consider options: https://gohugo.io/functions/css/tailwindcss/#options
- [ ] Copy over rest of content, make sure nothing is outright broken (but happy to fix things in main repo).
- [ ] Make sure RSS feed works when migrating.
- [ ] Make sure web stats are working.

Post repo merge todo:

- [ ] Reenable search

## Goals

- Modern Hugo
- Tailwind 4.1
- More visual site, added textures, color, animations, gradients
- Add search
- Avoid Google fonts.
- More modern photos of me?
- Improve web load speeds
- dark mode

## Requirements

- This is a Hugo site and as such you need to install Hugo.
- The `reborn` Hugo theme here, assumed Tailwind. It is currently install via the TailwindCLI from npm.
